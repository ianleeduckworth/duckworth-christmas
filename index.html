<h1>Welcome Duckworth Family</h1>
<h2>Presents!</h2>
  <p>
    During Hope's pregnancy with Clara we both took some time to exercise our hobbies and made many of our Christmas
    gifts this year.  This site will provide each of you with a list of what we got you and some fun ideas that each
    item could be used for (especially if it's a food or a baking ingredient).  Hopefully you find it useful!
  </p>
<h2>Updates!</h2>
  <p>
    It's Clara's first Christmas this year!  She'll only be about 4 months old on Christmas so she won't remember much
    but we are both super excited to celebrate Christmas with her and with all of you!
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you all so much for your love and support.  We love each and every one of you and are very thankful to have
    you all in our lives.  Hopefully these gifts and time together provide a token of our appreciation for each of you.
  </p>
