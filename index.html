  <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>Hope and Ian decided to make a bunch of home made Christmas gifts this year.  This site will provide some awesome
      tips/recipes etc. regarding how to use the gifts that you have received.  It also contains some family updates and
      some pictures.  It is updated every year to reflect what is happening each Christmas.</p>
    <p>Click your name in the header to see what your presents are.  Don't worry, if it's not Christmas yet you won't see
      your presents.  We're better web developers than that ;)</p>

  <h2>Presents!</h2>
    <p>
      During Hope's pregnancy with Clara we both took some time to exercise our hobbies and made many of our Christmas
      gifts this year.  This site will provide each of you with a list of what we got you and some fun ideas that each
      item could be used for (especially if it's a food or a baking ingredient).  Hopefully you find it useful!
    </p>
    <h2>Updates!</h2>
    <p>
      It's Clara's first Christmas this year!  She'll only be about 4 months old on Christmas so she won't remember much
      but we are both super excited to celebrate Christmas with her and with all of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you all so much for your love and support.  We love each and every one of you and are very thankful to have
      you all in our lives.  Hopefully these gifts and time together provide a token of our appreciation for each of you.
    </p>
