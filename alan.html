      <h1>Alan</h1>
      <h3>Dad, you have always been a great example of what a father figure should look like and you have helped me learn to be a good father
        to my own family now.  Your influence can't be understated in that regard and your own sacrifices as a father will last for generations
        to come.</h3>
      <h2>Pickled Hot Peppers</h2>
      <p>These hot peppers were grown fresh in the garden.  They are mad hot.  The peppers that are included in this mix are Maule's Red Hots,
        Buena Mulatas, and Caribbean Red Habaneros.  The Buena Mulatas and the Maule's Red Hots are hot but not too crazy, however the Caribbean
        Red Habaneros are very hot.  That said I actually removed the seed pods from all the Caribbean Red Habaneros so they should not be unbearable.
          They are great on pizzas or in pasta, They can also spice up a hot dog or hamburger, my favorite use for them though is on a deli sandwich.
        as well.</p>
      <p>I hope these don't give you heartburn or anything like that :(</p>
      <h2>Dried Oregano</h2>
      <p>
        We have been growing oregano for about two years now and it gets a little bigger and fuller every year.  It seemed almost
        silly not to dry some and give it to you.  Their freshness is awesome and beats what we've found in a grocery store.  The
        oregano is great in any sort of Italian pasta and is superb on home made pizza.  Any dish with sausage would do well with
        this dried oregano.  The oregano should keep for about a year.  Before each use check it to make sure no moisture has gotten in.
        If you smell something foul or see any mold on the leaves, do not use.</p>
      <h2>Hot Sauce</h2>
      <p class="lastParagraph">
        The hot sauce was also made from Caribbean Red Habaneros from the garden as well as some other peppers and ingredients.  No need to
        refrigerate.  Good on anything (except maybe cereal, but hey to each his/her own).
