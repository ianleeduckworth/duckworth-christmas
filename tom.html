      <h3>Tom, you are obviously too young to read this one yet but you are such a cute little boy.  It has been amazing
        to watch you grow up.  We all know you will grow up to be a great man.  Merry Christmas!<h3>
          <h2>Animal Coat Rack</h2>
          <p>
            I (Ian) have been trying to learn and create some carpentry projects and Hope has been looking to get re-acquainted
            with her painting skills so this one seemed like a perfectly logical choice.  The animal knobs are sold by Anthropologie
            and while Anthropologie is mosly overpriced hipster nonsense these ones were so cute that we had to find a user for them.
            I've been using some of the tools I've received via gifts and from Papa's tool bench.  It's been great to get to do some
            carpentry; I hope you all enjoy this one in particular.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would possibly make a great clothing rack for Tom as he gets a little older and you want him to have a few items
            of clothing available that he could easily put on, or it would make a great addition to a changing table in a nursery.
            That or just a nice decoration to remind him how his name is spelled :)
          </p>
          <h2>Car mat</h2>
          <p>
            This one doesn't require much explanation except to say that I (Ian) always wanted one of these when I was a kid and it
            just never seemed to work out in such a way that I had one.  Either way it seemed like a great toy for Tom to play with
            when he's just a little older.  I'm jealous of course, and I hope he'll let me play cars with him when we come visit!
          </p>
          <h2>Nativity Finger Puppets</h2>
          <p>
            These don't really require much explanation either but these seemed like a super cute way to start teaching Tom about
            Bible stories.  The story of Jesus' birth on Christmas seemed like a great story to start with!
