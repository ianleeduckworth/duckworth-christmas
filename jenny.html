      <h3>Mom, you are so good at infusing life into our conversations.  We've loved to see your transition into a
        grandmother for Clara, and I know she will grow to love you just like we do.  Thanks for everything.<h3>
          <h2>Strawberry Jam</h2>
          <p>We made this strawberry jam from locally grown fresh strawberries that we picked with friends during the
            middle of strawberry picking season.  We added sugar and fruit pectin and preserved the strawberries so they can
            be enjoyed any time of year.  The jam should keep for about a year.
          </p>
          <p>If you are looking for some fun things to do with strawberry jam,
            <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/32-sweet-and-savory-things-to-do-when-you-have-too-much-jam-193374" target="_blank">this site</a>
            has some awesome ideas.</p>
            <h2>Lavender Sugar</h2>
            <p>Lavender doesn't typically grow very well here in North Carolina but we found a few high and dry spots in the
              yard where it could thrive.  This lavender sugar is made from fresh lavender from our yard mixed with raw cane
              sugar.  It is ideal for teas, desserts and as an accent in baking.  The sugar should keep indefinitely.  If it seems like
              the sugar is compromised in any way, though, do not eat it.
            </p>

              for an awesome lavender sugar lemon cookie recipe, and
              <a href="https://www.smallfootprintfamily.com/lavender-lemonade-with-honey-recipe" target="_blank">this site</a>
              for a lavender sugar lemonade recipe that is super delicious (that recipe calls for fresh lavender but you can just use the
              lavender sugar and no fresh lavender.  You can also find a standard lemondade recipe and just some or all of the lavender sugar
              as a substitute for regular sugar.  Your choice!).
            </p>
            <h2>Rose Sugar</h2>
            <p>
              Roses are a recent addition to our garden.  We had a fairly successful year and wanted to give you all a way to
              enjoy the roses as well.  This rose sugar is made in a similar way as the lavender sugar except with rose petals as
              opposed to lavender buds.  It is also great in teas and desserts.  The sugar should keep indefinitely.  If it seems like
              the sugar is compromised in any way, though, do not eat it.
            </p>
            <h2>Lavender Extract</h2>
            <p>
              Last year we ordered several unique extracts to try and really enjoyed them.  We found that making an extract is as
              simple as infusing a desired plant leaf/stem/bud into a vodka solution.  Hope used up all of Ian's good vodka making
              these so you'd better enjoy them.  The extract is essentially just vodka so it should keep forever.
            </p>
            <h2>Mint Extract</h2>
            <p>
              Mint has been growing like a weed here in North Carolina.  The leaves are great to chew after a meal and are generally
              a great addition to the plant life we have here at our house.  This extract is a blend of three different types of
              mint plants and is great to use for baking; also it can be added to hot chocolate in the winter for a festive touch
              around the holidays!  Check out <a href="http://www.wineandglue.com/mint-chocolate-brownies/" target="_blank">this site</a>
              for a great mint chocolate brownie recipe!  The extract is essentially just vodka so it should keep forever.
            </p>
            <h2>Oregano</h2>
            <p>
              We have been growing oregano for about two years now and it gets a little bigger and fuller every year.  It seemed almost
              silly not to dry some and give it to you.  Their freshness is awesome and beats what we've found in a grocery store.  The
              oregano is great in any sort of Italian pasta and is superb on home made pizza.  Any dish with sausage would do well with
              this dried oregano.  The oregano should keep for about a year.  Before each use check it to make sure no moisture has gotten in.
              If you smell something foul or see any mold on the leaves, do not use.
            </p>
            <h2>Goat's Milk Soap</h2>
            <p class="lastParagraph">
              We are absolutely not going to lie to you on this one.. it is a re-gift.  We wanted you to have it though because it is
              awesome soap made by a friend of ours who actually raises goats.  They are 100% home made and have a great fragrance,
              so even if you never use it to wash your hands, hopefully it provides a nice aesthetic and de-stinks a stinky bathroom!
