<h1>Jenny</h1>
<h3>Mom, you are so good at infusing life into our conversations.  We've loved to see your transition into a
  grandmother for Clara, and I know she will grow to love you just like we do.  Thanks for everything.<h3>
<h2>Strawberry Jam</h2>
  <p>We made this strawberry jam from locally grown fresh strawberries that we picked with friends during the
    middle of strawberry picking season.  We added sugar and fruit pectin and preserved the strawberries so they can
    be enjoyed any time of year.
  </p>
<h2>Lavender Sugar</h2>
  <p>Lavender doesn't typically grow very well here in North Carolina but we found a few high and dry spots in the
    yard where it could thrive.  This lavender sugar is made from fresh lavender from our yard mixed with raw cane
    sugar.  It is ideal for teas, desserts and as an accent in baking.
  </p>
<h2>Rose Sugar</h2>
  <p>
    Roses are a recent addition to our garden.  We had a fairly successful year and wanted to give you all a way to
    enjoy the roses as well.  This rose sugar is made in a similar way as the Lavender sugar except with rose petals as
    opposed to lavender buds.  It is also great in teas and desserts.
  </p>
<h2>Lavender Extract</h2>
  <p>
    Last year we ordered several unique extracts to try and really enjoyed them.  We found that making an extract is as
    simple as infusing a desired plant leaf/stem/bud into a vodka solution.  Hope used up all of Ian's good vodka making
    these so you'd better enjoy them.
  </p>
<h2>Mint Extract</h2>
  <p>
    Mint has been growing like a weed here in North Carolina.  The leaves are great to chew after a meal and are generally
    a great addition to the plant life we have here at our house.  This extract is a blend of three different types of
    mint plants and is great to use for baking; also it can be added to hot chocolate in the winter for a festive touch
    around the holidays!
  </p>
<h2>Oregano</h2>
  <p>
    We have been growing oregano for about two years now and it gets a little bigger and fuller every year.  It seemed almost
    silly not to dry some and give it to you.  Their freshness is awesome and beats what we've found in a grocery store.  Enjoy!
  </p>
<h2>Goat's Milk Soap</h2>
  <p>
    We are absolutely not going to lie to you on this one.. it is a re-gift.  We wanted you to have it though because it is
    awesome soap made by a friend of ours who actually raises goats.  They are 100% home made and have a great fragrance,
    so even if you never use it to wash your hands, hopefully it provides a nice aesthetic and de-stinks a stinky bathroom!
