      We are sorry we don't get to see you more but that makes us all the more thankful when we do get to.<h3>
        <h2>Strawberry Jam</h2>
        <p>We made this strawberry jam from locally grown fresh strawberries that we picked with friends during the
          middle of strawberry picking season.  We added sugar and fruit pectin and preserved the strawberries so they can
          be enjoyed any time of year.
        </p>
        <h2>Lavender Sugar</h2>
        <p>Lavender doesn't typically grow very well here in North Carolina but we found a few high and dry spots in the
          yard where it could thrive.  This lavender sugar is made from fresh lavender from our yard mixed with raw cane
          sugar.  It is ideal for teas, desserts and as an accent in baking.
        </p>
        <h2>Rose Sugar</h2>
        <p>
          Roses are a recent addition to our garden.  We had a fairly successful year and wanted to give you all a way to
          enjoy the roses as well.  This rose sugar is made in a similar way as the Lavender sugar except with rose petals as
          opposed to lavender buds.  It is also great in teas and desserts.
        </p>
        <h2>Lavender Extract</h2>
        <p>
          Last year we ordered several unique extracts to try and really enjoyed them.  We found that making an extract is as
          simple as infusing a desired plant leaf/stem/bud into a vodka solution.  Hope used up all of Ian's good vodka making
          these so you'd better enjoy them.
        </p>
        <h2>Mint Extract</h2>
        <p>
          Mint has been growing like a weed here in North Carolina.  The leaves are great to chew after a meal and are generally
          a great addition to the plant life we have here at our house.  This extract is a blend of three different types of
          mint plants and is great to use for baking; also it can be added to hot chocolate in the winter for a festive touch
          around the holidays!
        </p>
        <h2>Soup Mug</h2>
        <p>
          Hope found this soup mug while out with friends passing time while waiting for the baby to arrive.  The colors
          are awesome and we thought they would look awesome in your house.
