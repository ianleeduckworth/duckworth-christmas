      <h2>Pickled Hot Peppers</h2>
      <p>These hot peppers were grown fresh in the garden.  They are mad hot.  The peppers that are included in this mix are Maule's Red Hots,
        Buena Mulatas, and Caribbean Red Habaneros.  The Buena Mulatas and the Maule's Red Hots are hot but not too crazy, however the Caribbean
        Red Habaneros are very hot.  They are tasty though.  They are great on pizzas or in pasta.  They can also spice up a hot dog or hamburger
        as well.</p>
      <h2>Hot Sauce</h2>
      <p class="lastParagraph">The hot sauce was also made from Caribbean Red Habaneros from the garden as well as some other peppers and ingredients.  No need to
      refrigerate.  Good on anything (except maybe cereal, but hey to each his/her own).</p>
