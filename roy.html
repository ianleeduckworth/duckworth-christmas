      <h2>Pickled Hot Peppers</h2>
      <p>
        These hot peppers were grown fresh in the garden.  They are mad hot.  The peppers that are included in this mix are Maule's Red Hots,
        Buena Mulatas, and Caribbean Red Habaneros.  The Buena Mulatas and the Maule's Red Hots are hot but not too crazy, however the Caribbean
        Red Habaneros are very hot.  That said I actually removed the seed pods from all the Caribbean Red Habaneros so they should not be unbearable.
          They are great on pizzas or in pasta, They can also spice up a hot dog or hamburger, my favorite use for them though is on a deli sandwich.
        as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Hot Sauce</h2>
      <p>
        The hot sauce was also made from Caribbean Red Habaneros from the garden as well as some other peppers and ingredients.  No need to
      refrigerate.  Good on anything (except maybe cereal, but hey to each his/her own).
      </p>
      <h2>Celery Salt</h2>
      <p>
        We grew celery in the garden this year.  Normal celery (the kind that you would find in the grocery store) doesn't really grow very well
        around here so we grew a special kind that is used mostly in seasonings.  The stalks aren't edible but the leaves are very potent and make
        a great seasoning when dried.  When they are preserved in salt they make a great celery salt that is great for seasoning soups and stews.
        Also, if you want to get really wild it is delicious on popcorn!
      </p>

      <h2>Hot Pepper Relish</h2>
      <p>Are you noticing a theme here?  We got an awesome yield on hot peppers this year and so I dug deep in my idea bin to think of some fun stuff
        to do with them.  This pepper relish is made of Maule's Red Hot peppers, onions and some other goodies used in making relish.  Note that it
        is pretty spicy but certainly not unbearable.  It is good on hot dogs in particular.  Also if you're looking for a fun and unique idea,
        <a href="https://blog.harryanddavid.com/pepper-relish-cream-cheese-dip-recipe/" target="_blank">this site</a> has a recipe for a hot pepper
        and cream cheese dip that would work great for a party.
